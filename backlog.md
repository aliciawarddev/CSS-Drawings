# Backlog

## Bugs
- standardized styling: make sure the items fit inside. Something has changed
- Ghost: remove gaps
- Glasses: add arms, add dotted border on the outside of the frames (like the bike wheel treads)
- Ghost: add waving arm
- Puzzle piece: add interlocking pieces
- Diamond ring: restructure to add panels inside the diamond, and fill them with different colors (inspiration: lynn fischer potion+crystals image)
- Pencil: add lined paper
- Key: add details
- Alice drink: Add tag
- Drink me - add texture to cork
- Tetris text: remove borders, use same settngs as tetris
- Soft serve: create dollop shape, add shadow to dollop shape, fix bottom shadow on the cone, add hashtags, fix cone shadow colors (enough contrastfghdfh)
- Add IDs to all sections, and match it to the id in the preview img href

## New Section - Template
- border box
- flexbox direction

## In Progress 
- Hot dog
    - use GPT generates images as reference
    - update the shapes
    - change colors
    - add shading
    - add details
- Sugar skull
    - fix alignment issues with the hearts
    - want the red one inside the pink one, centered, and can me moved around as 1 unit
    - create the basic shape of the skull
    - small flowers: make them their own thing, make the border more bold. Can't just be a scaled down version of the larger flower. 
    - change the background structure: head(furthest back), jaw (second), jaw(furthest forward).Adjust the order of the html so it makes more sense.  
    - adjust order of css to be easily scanned and best practices.
    - Change the code and structure so that items are truly center, and don't rely on px placement. 
    - fix the positioning of the entire skull: be fixed, not be moved up by adding more elements
- Cute Fruits
    - add eyes
    - add mouths
